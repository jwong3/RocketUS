    </div>
    <p>
        This web application is to help with the safety problem in Worcester. Many people will not go to a location if
        they are
        unsure of the safeness of it. When a person knows a location is safe they are more likely to go there.
        Similarly, if an
        area feels unsafe then people will be less inclined to use that area.
    </p>
    <p>
        This application is meant to help people with creating a setting of safety in the community of Worcester.
        Anyone can add a safeness rating
        of both the place and surrounding location.
        To do this, click on add a rating and choose from the drop down box.

        You can add a location by hitting add. And edit a location by double clicking on a row.
